--Noticable however, the 2nd session does not update the table. Recall that earlier, we turned off autocommit. From the mysql manual:
--By default, MySQL runs with autocommit mode enabled. This means that, when not otherwise inside a transaction, each statement is atomic, as if it were surrounded by START TRANSACTION and COMMIT.

--Further down this entry in the manual:
--After disabling autocommit mode by setting the autocommit variable to zero, changes to transaction-safe tables (such as those for InnoDB or NDB) **are not made permanent immediately**. You must use COMMIT to store your changes to disk or ROLLBACK to ignore the changes.
